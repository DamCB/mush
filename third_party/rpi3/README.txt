# Summary

This is a 3D-model of a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.

It can be used for experimenting around with the dimensions and ports of the Raspberry Pi, so you don't need to touch the electronics of the original Raspberry all the time (e.g. if you want to design or build a case).

All case relevant parts should be placed in the correct position according to the mechanical specs of the Raspberry Pi Foundation
https://www.raspberrypi.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mechanicalspecB+.png

Case relevant are all parts, that might need some cutouts in the case, like the ports, the SD card slot and the SOC's on top and bottom of the PCB:
- The SOC positions can be relevant if you're using heat sinks.
- The GPIO has a block form, so that you don't rip off the pins :-)

I made the model with FreeCad and could not print or test it yet - feedback is highly appreciated.

Update 2017-01-14:
---------------------------
Added the stl-file with the ending "Block". This model might be more suitable for 3D printing because it doesn't need any supports (eventually for the audio port). All ports (holes) have been plugged and the bottom has been flattened:
- the SOC has been replaced by a square hole (so you still know its place)
- the SD card has been "moved up" to the edge of the PCB

Just remember to add some notional 4mm on the bottom part of the PCB (SOC, SD card, soldering pins, etc.).

# How I Designed This

## Designed using FreeCAD
